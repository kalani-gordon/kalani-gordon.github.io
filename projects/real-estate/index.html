            <h3>About the home</h3>
            <!-- <p> <strong>Offer deadline: Sunday, Sept. 7, 8 p.m.</strong></p> -->
            <p>Step inside this thoughtfully renovated three-bedroom bungalow, where timeless charm meets bespoke
                detail.
                Golden
                pine wood floors set a warm foundation throughout, filling each room with natural character and an
                inviting
                glow. On the main level, you'll find a brick fireplace with a gas insert for ultimate convenience, a
                newly
                reimagined wet room offers spa-like relaxation with a sleek rain shower, moody designer wallpaper, and a
                window
                thoughtfully added to bring in natural light. </p>
            <p>The kitchen is both functional and stylish, featuring a cozy coffee nook and custom tilework, while the
                adjoining
                mudroom—an inspired addition off the home’s original exterior—boasts an elegant arched doorway and
                artisan
                tile
                across both backsplash and floor. Upstairs, you’ll
                find a beautifully updated full bath, wrapped in striking forest-green tile and grounded by modern black
                hexagon
                flooring. Each bedroom offers ample storage with generously sized closets, ensuring a place for
                everything.
                Outdoors, the private backyard has been transformed into a retreat with a custom brick patio and a stock
                tank
                pool that conveys with the home—perfect for entertaining or unwinding on warm evenings.</p>
            <p> The native flower garden
                has been planted around the perimeter of the brick patio for added privacy and enchantment. An oversized
                two-car
                garage provides abundant space for vehicles, storage, or a workshop. Natural light fills this home from
                every
                angle, accentuating its thoughtful design and creating an airy, uplifting atmosphere. </p>
            <p>This home is a rare blend of custom craftsmanship, modern
                updates,
                and
                community spirit—ready to welcome its next chapter. A full list of updates is included in the
                disclosures.
